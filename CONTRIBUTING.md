## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, and not all of them involve writing code.

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

If you find something that isn't working as expected, please open a new issue on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Noventis-Laplace-Project/Noventis-Data//issues). 

**When reporting bugs, please include:**
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Python version, Noventis version)
- Error messages or stack traces (if applicable)

### üí° Suggesting New Features

Have a brilliant idea for a new functionality? We'd love to hear it! Open a new issue and describe your idea in detail.

**When suggesting features, please include:**
- What problem does it solve?
- How should it work?
- Any examples or use cases

### üìù Improving Documentation

Found a typo or a confusing sentence in our documentation? Fixes to documentation are just as important as fixes to code.

### üîß Submitting Pull Requests

If you want to add a feature, fix a bug, or improve documentation, this is the best way to do it. Follow the workflow below!

## Your Contribution Workflow

Ready to start contributing? Follow these steps to set up your development environment and submit your first change.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the [Noventis GitHub page](https://github.com/Noventis-Laplace-Project/Noventis-Data/) to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Now, clone your fork to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/noventis.git
cd noventis
```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Always work inside a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or .\venv\Scripts\activate for Windows
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install the library in "editable" mode (`-e`). This means changes you make to the source code will take effect immediately without needing to reinstall.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Step 5: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch to work on your changes. Use a descriptive name.

**Branch naming conventions:**
- For new features: `feat/new-feature-name`
- For bug fixes: `fix/short-bug-description`
- For documentation: `docs/description`

```bash
git checkout -b feat/add-svm-model
```

### Step 6: Write Your Code!

Time to work your magic! Make your changes, add your features, or fix the bug. Be sure to follow our **Coding Standards** (see below).

### Step 7: Commit Your Changes

Use a clear and descriptive commit message. We recommend the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

**Commit types:**
- `feat:` for a new feature
- `fix:` for a bug fix
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `style:` for code style changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for SVM model in ManualPredictor"
```

### Step 8: Push to Your Fork

Upload your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feat/add-svm-model
```

### Step 9: Submit a Pull Request (PR)

1. Open your forked repository on GitHub
2. You will see a button to create a **Pull Request** - click it
3. Provide a clear title and description for your PR
4. Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
5. Submit the pull request

## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality and consistency, please follow these standards:

### Code Style

We use **Black** for automated code formatting. Please run `black .` before committing to automatically format your code.

```bash
black .
```

### Docstrings

All new public functions, classes, and methods must have a clear docstring explaining their purpose, parameters, and what they return.

**Example:**
```python
def predict(self, X):
    """
    Make predictions on input data.
    
    Args:
        X (array-like): Input features of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        
    Returns:
        array: Predictions of shape (n_samples,)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If model is not fitted
    """
    pass
```

### Testing

If you add new functionality, it's highly encouraged to add corresponding unit tests. Contributions that include tests are prioritized.

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=noventis
```

## Pull Request Review Process

Once you submit a PR, one of the project maintainers will review it. The process is as follows:

### 1. Initial Review
We will check if your PR is clear and aligns with the project's goals.

### 2. Feedback
We may provide comments or request some changes to improve the code quality.

### 3. Approval & Merge
Once all feedback is addressed and all automated checks (CI) have passed, your PR will be merged into the main branch.

**Congratulations!** üéâ Your contribution is now a part of Noventis.
